**Live Demo:** [https://smartairesume.netlify.app/](https://smartairesume.netlify.app/)


- **Frontend (React):**  
  UI with two tabs  
  1. Upload a new resume and display extracted information, resume rating, improvement areas, and upskill suggestions.  
  2. Show all previously uploaded resumes (from DB) in a table with a Details button that opens a modal showing the full extracted content.

- **Backend (Python â€“ Flask/FastAPI/Django):**  
  - Accept resume upload (PDF/DOCX).  
  - Extract as much structured data as possible (skills, work experience, education, projects, certifications, contact info, links, languages, etc.).  
  - Store extracted data in a database (SQLite by default, can switch to Postgres).  
  - Use Gemini free tier APIs with LangChain to analyze the resume:
    - Suggest improvements.
    - Recommend additional skills to learn/upskill.
  - Return all data in JSON.
